## Dataset (Member 1)

The raw dataset is **not** stored in this repo. Download it in Colab:

    !pip -q install wfdb
    import wfdb
    wfdb.dl_database('mitdb', dl_dir='/content/Group_7_ECG_Project/dataset/mitdb')

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Source | MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (PhysioNet) |
| Records downloaded | 48 |
| Records used | 44 (paced records 102, 104, 107, 217 excluded) |
| Sampling rate | 360 Hz |
| Leads | MLII (channel 0), V5 (channel 1) |
| Total beats | 100,733 |
| Normal beats | 90,125 |
| Abnormal beats | 10,608 |
| Abnormal % | 10.5% |

The dataset is imbalanced (normal beats are much more than abnormal). Use a record-wise split to avoid data leakage. Details: dataset/README.md

## Label definition (agreed by the team)

- **Normal (0):** N, L, R, e, j
- **Abnormal (1):** A, a, J, S, V, E, F, /, f, Q
- Paced records 102, 104, 107, 217 are excluded

## Preprocessing and split (Member 2)

- **Lead:** channel 0 (MLII)
- **Segment:** 360 samples, centered on each R peak (180 before, 180 after)
- **Filter:** Butterworth bandpass, 0.5 to 45 Hz, order 4
- **Normalization:** per-segment z-score
- **Split:** record-wise (no record appears in two splits)
- Beats too close to the start or end of a record (window does not fit) are dropped, so 100,733 annotated beats become 100,682 segments.

| Split | Records | Beats | Normal | Abnormal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Train | 30 | 68,386 | 62,790 | 5,596 |
| Validation | 7 | 16,399 | 14,553 | 1,846 |
| Test | 7 | 15,897 | 12,733 | 3,164 |

Record lists and full details: preprocessing/README.md

## Processed data (for Member 3 and Member 4)

File: **ecg_processed_v1.npz** (about 134 MB, hosted on Google Drive because it is too big for GitHub)

Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TO043QL8KSBiMkkf4Di5MMbLF5wXGgT0/view

| Array | Shape | Type |
|---|---|---|
| X_train | (68386, 360, 1) | float32 |
| y_train | (68386,) | int32 |
| X_val | (16399, 360, 1) | float32 |
| y_val | (16399,) | int32 |
| X_test | (15897, 360, 1) | float32 |
| y_test | (15897,) | int32 |

Load in Colab:

    !pip -q install gdown
    !gdown 1TO043QL8KSBiMkkf4Di5MMbLF5wXGgT0 -O ecg_processed_v1.npz

    import numpy as np
    d = np.load('ecg_processed_v1.npz')
    X_train, y_train = d['X_train'], d['y_train']
    X_val, y_val = d['X_val'], d['y_val']
    X_test, y_test = d['X_test'], d['y_test']

Train has far fewer abnormal beats (8.2%) than test (19.9%), so use class weights and judge models with recall, F1 and the confusion matrix, not accuracy alone.

## CNN-LSTM and CPU/GPU results (Member 4)

**Model:** ECG (360 x 1) -> 3 x (Conv1D + MaxPool) -> LSTM(64) -> Dense(32) -> Dropout(0.3) -> Sigmoid (Normal / Abnormal)

**Files:** notebooks/04_cnn_lstm_gpu_v1_Rohan_WORK.ipynb, models/cnn_lstm_v1.keras, results/cnn_lstm_*.csv, graphs/cnn_lstm_*.png

**Experiment settings** (Member 3 should use the same settings so the comparison is fair):

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Data | ecg_processed_v1.npz (same file as Member 3) |
| Seed | 42 |
| Batch size | 128 |
| Optimizer / learning rate | Adam, 0.001 |
| Loss | binary cross-entropy |
| Class weights | Normal 0.5446, Abnormal 6.1103 (balanced, from train set) |
| Epochs | max 15, early stopping on val_loss (patience 4, best weights restored) |
| Threshold | 0.5 (probability >= 0.5 means abnormal) |
| Precision | float32 (no mixed precision) |

**Test set results (Experiment A, trained on GPU):**

| Metric | CNN-LSTM |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.7605 |
| Precision (abnormal) | 0.4138 |
| Recall (abnormal) | 0.4880 |
| F1-score (abnormal) | 0.4479 |
| Specificity | 0.8282 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.7418 |
| Confusion matrix (TN / FP / FN / TP) | 10546 / 2187 / 1620 / 1544 |
| Epochs run / best epoch | 13 / 9 |
| Training time (GPU, 13 epochs) | 112.11 s (about 8.59 s per epoch) |

**CPU vs GPU (Experiment B, same model, data, seed, batch size, 5 epochs, no early stopping):**

| Metric | CPU | GPU | Speedup (CPU / GPU) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total training time (5 epochs) | 297.20 s | 33.94 s | 8.76x |
| Average epoch time (epoch 2 onward) | 60.64 s | 6.22 s | 9.75x |
| First epoch (includes warm-up) | 54.47 s | 8.80 s | - |
| Inference, full test set (15,897 beats) | 3.563 s | 0.479 s | 7.43x |
| Inference per beat | 0.2241 ms | 0.0302 ms | 7.42x |
| Test accuracy after 5 epochs | 0.7632 | 0.7671 | - |

**Runtime used (recorded 2026-10-04):** Google Colab, Tesla T4 GPU (15360 MiB), NVIDIA driver 580.82.07, CUDA 12.5.1, cuDNN 9, Intel Xeon CPU @ 2.00GHz (2 logical cores), about 12.7 GiB RAM, Python 3.13.15, TensorFlow 2.20.0, Keras 3.13.2. Full details: results/hardware_info_v1.json

**Notes and limitations:**

- Validation recall is high (0.85) but test recall is much lower (0.49). Validation loss is unstable and train accuracy is about 98%, so the model fits the training records much better than new records. Records are split record-wise, so test records are unseen patients.
- Each timing experiment was run once (TIMING_REPEATS = 1). Colab hardware can be different in another session, so timings should be compared only with runs on the same hardware.
- The CPU run uses tf.device('/CPU:0') inside the same Colab GPU runtime, with the same settings as the GPU run. Epoch time includes validation time.
- The CPU and GPU accuracy values differ slightly (0.7632 vs 0.7671) because they are separate 5-epoch runs with different compute kernels. They are not the same as the main model in the test results table.

## 1D-CNN results (Member 3)

**Model:** ECG (360 x 1) -> Conv1D(32, k=5) + MaxPool -> Conv1D(64, k=5) + MaxPool -> Flatten -> Dense(64) -> Dropout(0.5) -> Sigmoid (Normal / Abnormal). Total 379,265 parameters.

**Files:** notebooks/03_1d_cnn_Rishi_WORK.ipynb, models/1d_cnn_model.keras, results/1d_cnn_metrics.csv, results/1d_cnn_classification_report.csv, graphs/1d_cnn_accuracy.png, 1d_cnn_loss.png, 1d_cnn_confusion_matrix.png

**Settings:**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Data | ecg_processed_v1.npz (same file as Member 4, shapes checked in the notebook) |
| Seed | 42 |
| Batch size | 128 |
| Optimizer / learning rate | Adam, 0.001 (ReduceLROnPlateau: factor 0.5, patience 2, min 1e-5) |
| Loss | binary cross-entropy |
| Class weights | Normal 0.5446, Abnormal 6.1103 (balanced, from train set) |
| Epochs | max 30, early stopping on val_loss (patience 6, best weights restored) |
| Threshold | 0.5 (probability >= 0.5 means abnormal) |
| Precision | float32 |

Training used only X_train / X_val. The test set was used once, for the final evaluation of the best checkpoint.

**Test set results:**

| Metric | 1D-CNN |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.8066 |
| Precision (abnormal) | 0.5139 |
| Recall (abnormal) | 0.5193 |
| F1-score (abnormal) | 0.5166 |
| Macro F1 | 0.6978 |
| Specificity | 0.8780 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.8448 |
| Test loss | 0.5674 |
| Confusion matrix (TN / FP / FN / TP) | 11179 / 1554 / 1521 / 1643 |
| Epochs run / best epoch | 7 / 1 |
| Training time (7 epochs, no GPU visible in the run) | 462.6 s |

**1D-CNN vs CNN-LSTM (test set, threshold 0.5):**

| Metric | 1D-CNN | CNN-LSTM |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.8066 | 0.7605 |
| Precision (abnormal) | 0.5139 | 0.4138 |
| Recall (abnormal) | 0.5193 | 0.4880 |
| F1-score (abnormal) | 0.5166 | 0.4479 |
| Specificity | 0.8780 | 0.8282 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.8448 | 0.7418 |

**Notes and limitations:**

- Best validation loss (0.4543, val accuracy 0.8145) came at epoch 1. After that, train accuracy rose to about 98.8% while validation loss went up (0.62 to 0.78), so the model overfits the training records. Early stopping restored epoch 1 weights.
- Test records are unseen patients (record-wise split), and abnormal share is 19.9% in test vs 8.2% in train, so abnormal precision and recall are only about 0.51 to 0.52.
- Settings are the same as Member 4 for data, seed, batch size, optimizer, loss, class weights and threshold. Differences: max epochs 30 (vs 15), early stopping patience 6 (vs 4), and ReduceLROnPlateau is used.
- The 1D-CNN was run once; no repeated runs, so small differences between models should not be over-interpreted.

## Integration, final comparison and demo (Member 5)

**Files:** demo/app.py, demo/README.md, requirements.txt, report/ (README.md, report_v1.docx, report_v1.pdf), presentation/. All numbers below are copied from results/*.csv and results/*.json, nothing is estimated.

**Demo flow:** input ECG beat -> preprocessing (bandpass 0.5 to 45 Hz + per-segment z-score, same as Member 2) -> 1D-CNN and CNN-LSTM (one sigmoid output each, threshold 0.5) -> predicted class: Normal or Abnormal.

**Final model comparison (test set, 15,897 beats from 7 unseen records):**

| Metric | 1D-CNN (Member 3) | CNN-LSTM (Member 4) |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.8066 | 0.7605 |
| Precision (abnormal) | 0.5139 | 0.4138 |
| Recall (abnormal) | 0.5193 | 0.4880 |
| F1-score (abnormal) | 0.5166 | 0.4479 |
| Specificity | 0.8780 | 0.8282 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.8448 | 0.7418 |
| Confusion matrix (TN / FP / FN / TP) | 11179 / 1554 / 1521 / 1643 | 10546 / 2187 / 1620 / 1544 |

**Final CNN-LSTM CPU vs GPU (Tesla T4 vs 2-core Xeon):**

| Metric | CPU | GPU | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total training time (5 epochs) | 297.20 s | 33.94 s | 8.76x |
| Average epoch time (epoch 2 onward) | 60.64 s | 6.22 s | 9.75x |
| Inference, full test set | 3.563 s | 0.479 s | 7.43x |

**Conclusions (based only on the measured values above):**

- On this test set the 1D-CNN is better than the CNN-LSTM on every metric in the comparison table. The extra LSTM layer did not improve results here.
- Both models are weak on the abnormal class (F1 about 0.45 to 0.52). The test set has 19.9% abnormal beats while train has 8.2%, and test records are unseen patients.
- GPU gives about 7.4x to 9.8x speedup for the CNN-LSTM, depending on what is measured (inference, total training, steady epoch).
- Training time of the two models must not be compared directly: the 1D-CNN run (462.6 s, 7 epochs) had no GPU visible and used early stopping with max 30 epochs, while the CNN-LSTM main run (112.11 s, 13 epochs) used the T4 GPU.
- Each timing experiment was run once, so small differences should not be over-interpreted.

**Demo:** open the live demo (https://ecg-project-deeplearning-7bawjywtz5d2jpancnhnkz.streamlit.app/) or run `streamlit run demo/app.py`. Step 1 choose a test beat (or upload an ECG file), Step 2 see the preprocessing, Step 3 see both model predictions with P(abnormal), Step 4 see the evaluation tables, which the app reads directly from results/*.csv.

- Model output is a classification result, not a clinical diagnosis.

## How to Run Final Integrated Demo (Member 5)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run demo/app.py
```

Needs `models/` (both .keras files), `results/` and `ecg_processed_v1.npz` (Google Drive link above). Or just use the live demo link at the top and upload the file in the app. Models were saved with Keras 3.13.2, so use TensorFlow 2.20.0 as in requirements.txt. More details and troubleshooting: demo/README.md
